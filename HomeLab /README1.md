- **Internal Network Adapter (VMnet0)**: Enables communication with other VMs on the private network (as illustrated in the topology diagram below).

![Network adapter settings](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2b6bafa1-6d1f-4b02-a671-6f1b8e6ee532)

---

### 3. Operating System Installation

#### Windows Server 2022
- Boot the VM and select language/keyboard preferences.
- Click **Install now**.
- Choose **Windows Server 2022 Standard Evaluation (Desktop Experience)**.
- Accept the license terms and select **Custom: Install Windows only (advanced)**.
- Select the single disk and proceed with installation.
- After reboot, set a password for the built‑in **Administrator** account.

![Server installation progress](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2989496f-b310-4ed2-a02e-71b7b3094ed7)

---

### 4. Post‑Installation Server Configuration

#### 4.1 Rename Network Adapters
After logging in, identify the two network adapters:
- **Ethernet0** is the NAT adapter (DNS shows “localdomain”).
- **Ethernet1** will be used for internal communication.

![Identifying adapters](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1a9f9f1b-8f96-418b-8a2d-738b41bfc77f)

Rename them for clarity (e.g., “External” and “Internal”) to simplify subsequent configuration of the Domain Controller and DHCP.

![Renaming adapters](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fc799819-c867-4f7b-8cb8-178a36c9c846)

#### 4.2 Configure Internal Network Adapter
Assign the internal adapter a static IP address as per the network diagram (e.g., **172.16.0.1**).  
- **Default Gateway**: Leave blank (the Domain Controller will act as gateway).  
- **DNS Server**: Use the same IP (the loopback address) because Active Directory will automatically install DNS.

![Static IP configuration](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0099c3da-d8bd-4b6f-992f-b69da8b8ca8c)

#### 4.3 Rename the Computer
Rename the server to **DC** (Domain Controller) to simplify identification. A reboot is required.

![Renaming the PC](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a4d4a13c-9120-44ae-b0f9-1ca3c704237e)

---

### 5. Install and Configure Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)

#### 5.1 Install AD DS Role
After rebooting, open Server Manager and add the **Active Directory Domain Services** role.

![Adding AD DS role](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6eb7b3d5-5931-4418-96f7-9361e4ee841f)

#### 5.2 Promote Server to Domain Controller
Once the role is installed, promote the server to a Domain Controller and create a new forest with the domain name **VirtualLab.local**.

![Promotion to DC](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a02fff50-8904-4b51-9002-39f6c4f1b4ad)

After promotion, the server restarts. Upon logging back in, the administrator account will show the domain prefix (e.g., **VIRTUALLAB\Administrator**), confirming successful domain creation.

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/73a4d330-b671-48b8-8c6d-728640efd2c8

#### 5.3 Create a Dedicated Domain Admin Account
Instead of using the built‑in Administrator account, create a dedicated domain admin account for daily administration.

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ab4a0048-bd76-4878-8a15-48bef186dac5

After creation, add this new user to the **Domain Admins** security group using Active Directory Users and Computers. Then log out and log in with the new domain admin credentials.

---

### 6. Configure Remote Access (RAS/NAT)

To allow client machines on the internal network to access the internet through the Domain Controller, install and configure the **Remote Access** role with NAT.

#### 6.1 Install Remote Access Role
Add the **Remote Access** role via Server Manager, selecting the **Routing** role service.

![Installing Remote Access](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/036c896f-ef3a-42fa-88f7-46762c98f783)

#### 6.2 Configure NAT
After installation, open **Routing and Remote Access** from the Tools menu, right‑click the server, and select **Configure and Enable Routing and Remote Access**. Choose **Network Address Translation (NAT)** and select the external network interface (the NAT adapter) to share the internet connection.

![Configuring NAT](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/27e6d5bd-f7dd-4a78-9544-19c2dae7b894)

---

### 7. Install and Configure DHCP Server

To automatically assign IP addresses to client machines on the internal network, install the **DHCP Server** role.

#### 7.1 Install DHCP Role
Add the DHCP Server role via Server Manager.

![Installing DHCP](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/94357488-7af2-4d80-892d-6f0a5a8da89f)

#### 7.2 Create a DHCP Scope
After installation, open the DHCP management console and create a new scope:
- **Scope Name**: Internal Clients
- **IP Address Range**: 192.168.1.100 – 192.168.1.200 (100 addresses)
- **Lease Duration**: 8 days (suitable for a lab environment)

The scope defines the pool of addresses that DHCP can assign to clients. The lease duration ensures that an IP address is reserved for a device for a specified period, preventing exhaustion of available addresses.

![Creating DHCP scope](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1e3a12ff-4dd1-4a09-86ef-51418ba07ac9)

---

### 8. Deploy and Configure Client Machine (CLIENT-1)

#### 8.1 Create Client VM
Create a new VM named **CLIENT-1** using the Windows 10 ISO.  
- **Network Adapter**: Set to **Internal Network (VMnet0)** – the same network as the Domain Controller’s internal adapter. This ensures the client can only obtain an IP from the DHCP server on the DC and access the internet via NAT.

![Client VM creation](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b5b814c5-02b6-43e1-8d69-cf419070fa79)

#### 8.2 Join the Domain
After installing Windows 10, rename the computer to **CLIENT-1** and join the **VirtualLab.local** domain. When prompted for credentials, use the previously created domain admin account.

![Joining the domain](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bd5f839e-3ff8-4191-a95c-769d28fe0644)

#### 8.3 Create a Test User
In Active Directory Users and Computers, create a new domain user (e.g., **TestUser**) to simulate a typical employee account. This user can later log in to CLIENT-1.

![Creating a new user](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1d1a0332-2b7f-4070-a3fc-1b857d74fe4e)
![User creation confirmation](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/21d594ce-b887-47d4-bc42-a57aac163865)

---

### 9. Verification and Testing

After completing the configuration, several tests were performed to ensure the environment is functioning correctly.

#### 9.1 Client IP Assignment and Connectivity
From the client VM (CLIENT-1), the `ipconfig` command confirms that it has received a valid IP address from the DHCP server running on the Domain Controller. Additionally, pinging the domain name (`VirtualLab.local`) succeeds, indicating proper DNS resolution and network connectivity.

![IP configuration and ping test](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/85b32f49-5073-4ddc-a8dd-8f67f215fde7)

#### 9.2 End‑to‑End Functionality Test
A comprehensive test was conducted to validate the entire work environment, including the bulk users created. The successful login and access to resources confirm that the domain, authentication, and network services are operating as expected.

![Environment functionality test](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d8802488-aa2b-4703-8a7c-d65f8d313ff6)

#### 9.3 Reviewing DHCP Leases
Returning to the Domain Controller, the DHCP console shows the active address leases. The lease for CLIENT-1 is present, confirming that the DHCP server successfully assigned an IP from the defined scope. In a production environment, this list would contain many more entries, depending on the lease duration and network size.

![DHCP lease list](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4f50d3c2-7dbb-479d-b349-3524aef8d128)

#### 9.4 Verifying Computer Objects in Active Directory
Active Directory Users and Computers reveals that CLIENT-1 has been registered as a computer object in the domain. This automatic registration is a key aspect of domain membership and confirms that the client is properly joined to the domain.
