## Monitoring and Visualization
In this section, I will install and integrate two programs, Zabbix and Grafana, to monitor client machines. This setup will enable real-time tracking and management of system performance and network activity. The primary reasons for including Zabbix, a robust monitoring tool, and Grafana, a powerful real-time data visualization program, in my homelab are:

Proactive Issue Detection: Zabbix will help in identifying and addressing potential issues, such as hardware failures, software crashes, or network disruptions, before they impact the system's functionality. Grafana will provide a clear, visual representation of these issues, making them easier to understand and act upon.

Performance Optimization: Continuous monitoring with Zabbix and real-time data analysis through Grafana will allow for fine-tuning system performance and ensuring efficient resource utilization.

Security Enhancement: By using Zabbix to keep a close watch on system activities and Grafana to visualize security metrics, I can quickly detect any unauthorized access or unusual behavior, thereby strengthening the security of the environment.

Learning and Experimentation: Implementing Zabbix and Grafana will provide hands-on experience in setting up, configuring, and utilizing monitoring and data visualization technologies, which are critical skills for IT management and cybersecurity.
