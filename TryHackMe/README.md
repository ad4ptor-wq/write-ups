 My Cybersecurity Write-ups

Hi there  
I’m Alex, learning penetration testing and documenting my progress here.  
This repository contains my CTF challenges, and lab write-ups.  

 Structure
- `easy/` → beginner-level challenges  
- `medium/` → intermediate challenges  
- `hard/` → advanced challenges  
- `scripts/` → automation scripts (nmap, enum, etc.)  
- `notes/` → general pentesting notes (Linux, PrivEsc, web vulnerabilities, etc.)  

 Goals
- Track and document my learning journey  
- Share knowledge with the cybersecurity community  
- Build a portfolio for future job opportunities  

 Notes
- Always document your steps, even partial solutions  
- Include commands, scripts, and screenshots if possible  
- Focus on both technical execution and explanation of reasoning
